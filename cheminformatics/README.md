# The tasks
* Read-in the file sampleMolecules.csv into Pandas data frame (get familar with pandas)
* The first row of this file is a header with column names
* In the column "canonicalSmiles" you have the canonical SMILES code
* By using the RDKit library create the Molecule object (get familar with this manual: https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html)
* Once you have the molecule objects calculate the basic molecular descriptors like: molecular weight, nuber of valence electrons.
